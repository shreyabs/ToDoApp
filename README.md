# ToDoApp

Something I came up with a couple of hours of coding. Currently has two listviews one below the other showing dummy values.
Clicking on a ToDo in the top list moves it to the bottom list and vice versa.

TODO: Replace dummy values with a DB using Room
Started this project as an experiment in Room. There's a class that is annotated and has a DAO as well, will start work on the DB module soon.
